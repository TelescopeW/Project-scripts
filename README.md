# Project-scripts
Summer project 2023

This is a storage and version control system for the pymol scripts, containing mainly scripts to make 
ensemble pdb files and all the conglomeration pdb files

Description of each script: 

 ensemble.pml:
  This script is to make a single ensemble structure named ensemble.pdb from the conformations named conformation1_x, conformation2_x, etc
  with x representing the total conformation given by pymol when using mutagenesis on single amino acid. 
  Note: that the total number of iteration within the script need to be changed according to total number of conformations generated by pymol on different 
  mutagenesis wizard. 

mutagenesis.pml: 
 This script is to save all the conformation given by pymol mutagenesis wizard separately. 
 Note: the loop in the script will not work.
